## AtomicRegister
This project entails developing a Rust-based user-space library for the Atomic Disk Drive, a distributed block storage system. The library will adhere to the (N, N)-AtomicRegister algorithm, allowing multiple instances to work together, tolerate crashes, and ensure data integrity within the distributed system. This component will complement the Linux block device driver to create a complete Atomic Disk Drive system.
